        <h1>Introduction: JavaScript Library for Arduino</h1>
        <p>
            Writing Arduino programs using JavaScript and run through your web browser is the main concept of uno.js. This library communicate with the microcontroller that has connected to your PC and reads values from sensors and modules to do any kind of calculation in web environment. Look at the following advantages you will experiance using uno.js Library.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Combine both JavaScript and Arduino technologies together</li>
            <li>No need of installing programs to microcontroller again and again</li>
            <li>Run or test programs, locally or hosted in anywhere in the internet</li>
            <li>Develop larger programs without worring about the storage</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            To sum up, you will be able to write Arduino programs using JavaScript and test them in your web browser that connected to your controller without installing.
        </p>
        <h1>Microcontrollers and Web Technology</h1>
        <p>
            We all know that devices connects to PC (USB), transfer infromation using serial communication. Even Arduino do the same thing. We read the values that calculated from Arduino controllers through the Serial Monitor that uses the serial communication.
        </p>
        <p>
            The idea of uno.js is generated due to the features that modern web browsers have. Today web browsers are able to access serial ports to read and write data to them.
        </p>
        <p>
            Because of that, we can access the values that sent from an Arduino controller through your web browser. uno.js library is developed to use serial communication technology to provide commands to Arduino controllers and retrieve information such as voltage reading and other sensor readings. To do this kind of operation, an Arduino client program comes with uno.js to install to your microcontroller only for the very first time. The you can write JavaScript programs and client is there in your controller to accept your commands and do what you say.
        </p>
        <h1>Sensors and Modules</h1>
        <p>
            There are thausands of devices that you can connect to an Arduino microcontroller. Many devices provide various of redings from physical environment around us. That's make the Arduino very special to come up with new ideas. uno.js is developed to break the barrior between JavaScript platform and Arduino to experiance new level of web technology.
        </p>
        <p>
            You will be able to controll the web environment using Arduino at the same time you controll the Arduino from the web browser. Projects in the internet will be easier to test due to no requirement of downloading and installing.
        </p>
        <p>
            Few sensors and modules that require additional libraries are already included in the client program and there will be more soon.
        </p>
        <h1>Importance of Ideas and Thinking</h1>
        <p>
            I have published uno.js as an open source library that anyone can use in their projects and improve functionalities itself. Therefore, you are free to think of new ideas and make the technology available and accessible to everyone, everywhere.
        </p>
